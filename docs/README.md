All pages on my website are interlinked, exept for the blogposts, 
which are only liknked to "blog" page. 

Home page features about me section which consist of a picture of me and an article. It's very simple and is ment to give minimalistic vibe, not overwhelming the user. All pages have a navigation bar and a footer. 

Scrolling down on the same page you will came across my projects section, displaying screenshots of projects I've worked on, title and 'about' section. Javascript was needed to be able to have the image as a link, that upon clicking, takes you to the website, and at the same time have a layover over it, which will dissapear when hovering. Colorful screenshots and hoverig effect keep it interesting and draw the user. 

Blog page consist of 6 identical cards filled with placefiller text. Each card has title, introduction, date and a button to read more. Cards have a scale effect on hover and buttons turn transparent on hover. Each card is linked to the same blogpost. Blogpost has a back button, which takes you on 'blog' page. It also has a title, date, author and an aticle with embedded picture. 

Contact page is very simple. It has a link to download a mock resume, my email and soial media links with interactive google maps at the bottom of the page. I added it to show which city I'm located at and it makes the simple page with few lines of code a bit more interesting.
