The purpose of my website is to introduce myself, showcase my work and skills and attract either freelance work or future employers. 
The target audience is potential future clients or employers.

I have chosen simple and clean design, which does not overwhelm the viewer. I have used accent colour and hover effects to engage and keep the audience interested.

All pages on my website are interlinked, except for the blog posts, 
which are only linked to "blog" page. 

Home page features about me section which consist of a picture of me and an article. It's very simple and is meant to give minimalist vibe, not overwhelming the user. All pages have a navigation bar and a footer.

Scrolling down on the same page you will come across my projects section, displaying screenshots of projects I've worked on, title and 'about' section. Javascript was needed to be able to have the image as a link, that upon clicking, takes you to the website, and at the same time have a layover over it, which will disappear when hovering. Colorful screenshots and hovering effect keep it interesting and draw the user.

Blog page consist of 6 identical cards filled with place filler text. Each card has title, introduction, date and a button to read more. Cards have a scale effect on hover and buttons turn transparent on hover. Each card is linked to the same blog post. Blog post has a back button, which takes you on 'blog' page. It also has a title, date, author and an article with embedded picture.

Contact page is very simple. It has a link to download a mock resume, my email and social media links with interactive google maps at the bottom of the page. I added it to show which city I'm located at and it makes the simple page with few lines of code a bit more interesting.
